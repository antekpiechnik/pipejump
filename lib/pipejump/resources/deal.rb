module Pipejump

  # A Deal is represented by an instance of Pipejump::Deal.
  #
  # *Note*: To access any deals, you need a valid Session instance, referred to as @session in the following examples.
  #
  # == Access
  #
  # === Collection
  #
  # To fetch a collection of Pipejump::Deal instances, call
  #
  #
  #      @session.deals
  #      # => #<Pipejump::Collection resource: Pipejump::Deal>
  #
  #
  # This returns a Pipejump::Collection instance. To retrieve an array of Pipejump::Deal instances, call the _all_ method on the collection:
  #
  #
  #      @session.deals.all
  #      # => [#<Pipejump::Deal name: "Good Deal", scope: "0", hot: "false", stage_name: "incoming", deal_tags: "", id: "1">,
  #      #     #<Pipejump::Deal name: "Ok Deal", scope: "0", hot: "false", stage_name: "incoming", deal_tags: "", id: "2">]
  #
  #
  # Instead of _all_, you can also call a variety of Array methods in the collection which will be delegated to the array returned by _all_, such as:
  #
  # * first
  # * last
  # * each
  # * size
  # * collect
  # * reject
  #
  # *Examples*:
  #
  #      @session.deals.first
  #      # => #<Pipejump::Deal name: "Good Deal", scope: "0", hot: "false", stage_name: "incoming", deal_tags: "", id: "1">
  #      @session.deals.last
  #      # => #<Pipejump::Deal name: "Ok Deal", scope: "0", hot: "false", stage_name: "incoming", deal_tags: "", id: "2">
  #      @session.deals.size
  #      # => 2
  #      @session.deals.each { |deal| puts deal.name }
  #      # Prints out "Good Deal" and "Ok Deal"
  #      @session.deals.collect { |deal| deal.name }
  #      # => ["Good Deal",  "Ok Deal"]
  #      @session.deals.reject { |deal| deal.name == 'Good Deal' }
  #      # => ["Ok Deal"]
  #
  #
  # === Resource
  #
  # To fetch a single deal, call the _find_ method with the deal id as an argument:
  #
  #
  #      @session.deals.find(1)
  #      # => #<Pipejump::Deal name: "Good Deal", scope: "0", hot: "false", stage_name: "incoming", deal_tags: "", id: "1">
  #
  #
  # == Creation
  #
  # *Note*: Deals require the following fields in the hash of attributes:
  #
  # * _name_: a valid name
  # * _client_id_: a valid a Client id
  #
  # To create a new deal, call the _create_ method on the Deal Pipejump::Collection with a hash of attributes as an argument.
  #
  #
  #      @session.deals.create(:name => 'Great Deal', :client_id => 1)
  #      # => #<Pipejump::Deal name: "Great Deal", scope: "0", hot: "false", stage_name: "incoming", deal_tags: "", id: "3">
  #
  #
  # If the deal was created properly, it will be returned with a id assigned to it. You can check it by calling the created? method
  #
  #
  #      deal = @session.deals.create(:name => 'Great Deal', :client_id => 1)
  #      # => #<Pipejump::Deal name: "Great Deal", scope: "0", hot: "false", stage_name: "incoming", deal_tags: "", id: "3">
  #      deal.created?
  #      # => true
  #      deal = @session.deals.create(:name => '')
  #      # => #<Pipejump::Deal name: "">
  #      deal.created?
  #      # => false
  #
  #
  # You can access validation/creation errors by calling the _errors_ method on the instance returned by _create_:
  #
  #
  #      deal = @session.deals.create(:name => '')
  #      # => #<Pipejump::Deal name: "">
  #      deal.created?
  #      # => false
  #      deal.errors
  #      # => {"deal"=>[{"error"=>{"code"=>"E0001", "field"=>"name", "description"=>"Please enter a deal name"}},
  #      #    {"error"=>{"code"=>"E0001", "field"=>"client", "description"=>"Please enter a valid client id"}}]}
  #
  #
  # == Update
  #
  # To update a deal, change the attributes and call the _save_ method.
  #
  # === Changing attributes
  #
  # Each attribute has an accessor which you can use to change the values:
  #
  #
  #      deal = @session.deals.create(:name => 'Great Deal', :client_id => 1)
  #      # => #<Pipejump::Deal name: "Great Deal", scope: "0", hot: "false", stage_name: "incoming", deal_tags: "", id: "3">
  #      deal.name
  #      # => 'Great Deal'
  #      deal.name = 'Super Deal'
  #      # => 'Super Deal'
  #      deal.name
  #      # => 'Super Deal'
  #
  #
  # === Saving
  #
  # Once you've changed the attributes, call the _save_ method on the deal instance:
  #
  #
  #      deal = @session.deals.create(:name => 'Great Deal', :client_id => 1)
  #      # => #<Pipejump::Deal name: "Great Deal", scope: "0", hot: "false", stage_name: "incoming", deal_tags: "", id: "3">
  #      deal.name = 'Super Deal'
  #      # => 'Super Deal'
  #      deal.save
  #      # => true
  #
  #
  # _save_ returns _true_ if save was successful and _false_ if it failed. In the latter scenario, you can access the errors via the _errors_ method:
  #
  #
  #      deal = @session.deals.create(:name => 'Great Deal', :client_id => 1)
  #      # => #<Pipejump::Deal name: "Great Deal", scope: "0", hot: "false", stage_name: "incoming", deal_tags: "", id: "3">
  #      deal.name = 'Super Deal'
  #      # => 'Super Deal'
  #      deal.save
  #      # => true
  #      deal.name = ''
  #      # => ''
  #      deal.save
  #      # => false
  #      deal.errors
  #      # => {"deal"=>[{"error"=>{"code"=>"E0001", "field"=>"name", "description"=>"Please enter a deal name"}} ]}
  #
  #
  # == Removal
  #
  # You cannot remove a deal, you can move it between stages
  #
  # == Changing stages
  #
  # To change a Deal stage, change the value of the _stage_name_ attribute to one of the following:
  #
  # * incoming
  # * qualified
  # * quote
  # * closure
  # * won
  # * lost
  # * unqualified
  #
  # Afterwards, save the deal to update the Deal stage.
  #
  #
  #      deal = @session.deals.create(:name => 'Great Deal', :client_id => 1)
  #      # => #<Pipejump::Deal name: "Great Deal", scope: "0", hot: "false", stage_name: "incoming", deal_tags: "", id: "3">
  #      deal.stage_name = 'qualified'
  #      # => 'qualified'
  #      deal.save
  #      # => true
  #
  #
  # == Contacts
  #
  # You can access Deal Contacts assigned to a deal by calling _contacts_ on an instance of a Deal:
  #
  #
  #      @deal.contacts
  #
  #
  # For more information, consult the Deal Contacts page.
  #
  # == Notes
  #
  # You can access Notes of a specific deal by calling _notes_ on an instance of a Deal:
  #
  #
  #      @deal.notes
  #
  #
  # For more information, consult the Notes page.
  #
  # == Reminders
  #
  # You can access Reminders of a specific deal by calling _reminders_ on an instance of a Deal:
  #
  #
  #      @deal.reminders
  #
  #
  # For more information, consult the Reminders page.
